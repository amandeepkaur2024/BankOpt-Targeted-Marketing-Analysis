**Objective:**<br>
The objective of the "BankOpt: Targeted Marketing Analysis" project is to leverage data analytics to optimize targeted marketing strategies for a banking institution. By analyzing customer demographic and behavioral data, including age, job type, marital status, education level, credit status, and banking interactions (such as loan status and average balance), the project aims to identify key customer segments and their likelihood of subscribing to term deposits. Through this analysis, the project seeks to develop personalized marketing campaigns tailored to specific customer profiles, maximizing the effectiveness of marketing efforts and improving the bank's subscription rates for term deposits. Additionally, the project aims to evaluate past marketing campaign outcomes and leverage predictive analytics to enhance customer engagement and retention strategies, ultimately driving business growth and profitability for the bank.
